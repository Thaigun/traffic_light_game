Traffic light game
==================

This was a school project I made during my first year studies. Back in time, I wasn't very aware of what to include in the .gitignore file so there might be something Eclipse-specific files left behind.

It has been a while since I worked on it, so if you really want to try it, you must figure out how to build and run it yourselves (or ask me to work out some instructions).
